Path Kata Solutions
===================

Solutions for the Paths functional programming kata: https://tyrcho.github.io/path-kata

How it's organized
------------------
There are different implementations with different styles each in one
python file (with test nomenclature to simplify pytest execution):
- `test_oop.py` contains an Object Oriented Programming aproach
- `test_pseudo_fp.py` contains a _pseudo_ Functional Programming aproach

Steps summary
-------------
1. Compute the distance of a segment
2. Compute the distance of a path
3. Find the shortest path in a list of paths
4. Enumerate all stops in a path
5. Filter paths keeping only those which include a stop
6. Filter paths keeping only those which include a given list of stops
7. Find the shortest path in a list of paths, which includes a given list of stops
8. (Bonus) Compute all possible paths between 2 points, given a list of Segments.
